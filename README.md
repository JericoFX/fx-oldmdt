# FX-OLDMDT

This is just a personal project, using TUICSS (https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/TuiCss) and svelte to create an OLD style mdt. Why? because i like it lol, again is for personal use, if you want to use it you will need to wait until i create the lua part, this code use Project Error Svelte (https://github.com/project-error/svelte-lua-boilerplate)
